===========================================

# This fork's README:

This fork was created to update the philferriere clone with newer commits from original repo.

Please go through the `cocodataset-master` branch of this repo to use the up to date code from original repo.

# Progress of work and installation

Commits from original repo up till commit id `8c9bcc3cf640524c4c20a9c40e89cb6a2f2fa0e9` of master branch have been
merged in this branch at the time of updating this README.

This branch has been tested for python `v3.7` on Windows 10 with Anaconda.

Sample notebooks provided may have issues unrelated to this project, but needs further investigation and work.

Python `v2.x` has been tested, but installation doesn't work.

I am accepting PRs for any fixes for 2.7, but might not end up working on it myself.

Installation should be as follows:
